To paste code into iPython:

%cpaste

You can't copy to iPython directly. These are the steps:

Copy the lines you want to copy into iPython into the clipboard
Enter %paste into iPython
Press enter

%paste requires Tkinter though, so if you don't have that another good bet is %cpaste

You actually can copy code to iPython directly, you may have to first disable auto-indentation by entering:
%autoindent

Paste & execute a pre-formatted code block from clipboard.

You must terminate the block with '--' (two minus-signs) or Ctrl-D alone on the line.
You can also provide your own sentinel with '%paste -s %%' ('%%' is the new sentinel for this operation).

The block is de-dented prior to execution to enable execution of method definitions.
'>' and '+' characters at the beginning of a line are ignored, to allow pasting directly from e-mails, diff files and doctests (the '...' continuation prompt is also stripped).
The executed block is also assigned to variable named 'pasted_block' for later editing with '%edit pasted_block'.

You can also pass a variable name as an argument, e.g. '%cpaste foo'.
This assigns the pasted block to variable 'foo' as string, without dedenting or executing it (preceding >>> and + is still stripped)

'%cpaste -r' re-executes the block previously entered by cpaste. '%cpaste -q' suppresses any additional output messages.
